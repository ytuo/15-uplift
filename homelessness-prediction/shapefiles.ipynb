    "# CoC to Census Tract Mapping\n",
    "In this section, we will associate each Continuum of Care (CoC) with relevant census data, such as census level demographics, income, and cost of living data. To do so, we will use shape files of each CoC and US Census Bureau tracts. Note that tracts may change on an annual basis; therefore, these data must be generated for each year."
